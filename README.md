<h1>Cartoonizer Project with OpenCV</h1>
A simple image processing project that converts an input image into a cartoonized version using Python and OpenCV. This project applies edge detection and bilateral filtering to create a cartoon-like effect on any image.


This project uses OpenCV to transform an ordinary image into a cartoon-styled image. By applying adaptive thresholding for edges and bilateral filtering for smoothing, we can produce a "cartoon" version of any input image.

<h3>Features:</h3>
Edge Detection: Detects and highlights edges to create the cartoon effect.
Image Smoothing: Uses bilateral filtering to smooth colors while preserving edges.
Versatile Display: Works both in local environments and Google Colab.
Technologies
Python: Programming Language
OpenCV: Open-source library for image processing
NumPy: For handling arrays


Make sure your image file (e.g., screenshot.jpeg) is located in the same directory as your script.
